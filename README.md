# Password Generator ðŸ”‘â€‹
This is a simple password generator written in Java. The application allows the user to customize the password generation by including different combinations of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special symbols.

## How it works
The program will ask questions about the user's preferences for generating the password. 
Answer the questions by inserting "y" or "n" as appropriate. 
Next, you will be prompted to enter the desired password length (between 6 and 20).
<br>
The program will generate a password based on the user's preferences and print it on the console.
